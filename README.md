The first part of the challenge is outlined in a PDF document titled 'Exploratory Test', which provides the necessary information and guidelines. This document contains essential details for completing the initial phase of the challenge.

Additionally, there is a second folder available that contains all the automated tests. To access the automated tests, navigate to the 'Cypress' folder, and within it, you will find the 'e2e' tests. This folder includes the scripts and configurations needed to run the automated tests for the challenge, enabling you to validate your solutions in a more efficient manner.
