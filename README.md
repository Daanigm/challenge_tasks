The first part of the challenge is outlined in a PDF document titled 'Exploratory Test,' which contains all the necessary information and guidelines. In this document, you’ll find the essential details for completing the initial phase of the challenge.

Additionally, there is a second folder that contains all the automated tests. To access these, navigate to the 'Cypress' folder, and within it, you’ll find the 'e2e' tests. This folder includes the scripts and configurations needed to run the automated tests for the challenge, allowing you to validate the solutions more efficiently.
