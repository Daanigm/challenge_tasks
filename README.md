The first part of the challenge is outlined in a PDF document titled "Exploratory Test," which contains all the necessary information and guidelines. In this document, you'll find the key details for completing the first phase of the challenge.

For the first test, I used the Gherkin language. Gherkin helps define tests in a simple and easy-to-understand way, using a structure that everyone can follow. It allows us to write tests in the format Given-When-Then (For example: Given some condition, When an action happens, Then we expect a result). This makes it easier for everyone on the team, including non-technical people, to understand how the system is supposed to behave.

For automating the tests, I used Cypress with JavaScript. Cypress is a tool that helps run tests automatically in a browser. It's quick, easy to use, and makes it simple to check if everything is working correctly. Using Cypress with JavaScript helps write tests that can run automatically, saving time and making sure everything is checked properly.

Thereâ€™s also a second folder that contains all the automated tests. To find them, go to the "Cypress" folder, and inside, you'll find the "e2e" tests. This folder has all the scripts and settings needed to run the automated tests for the challenge, helping you check the solutions more efficiently.
